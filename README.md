# Awesome Sandbox

I created this repository to learn shell scripting.

It is mostly focused on key fundamentals I learned during school and will cover any additional outside material I come across (which will be referenced for anyone else that is interested in learning).

# Purpose?

I personally found breaking down new things and applying them into real life to be the quickest way to understand new concepts/technologies I was otherwise unfamiliar with. Plus it's fun starting from 0!

# What is a shell script?

Program written in shell’s own programming language (is an ‘interpreted’ language)

Lets you put a collection of commands into a file

# Power of Scripting?

1. Being able to run commands based on conditional statements
2. Being able to check success or failure of commands in the script and writing logic to handle that
3. Being able to repeatedly run certain commands using loops

# Highlights

This collection of micro projects highlight the following fundamentals in C programming language (not in any order):

1. Essential Linux Commands
2. Shell Variables/ Environment Variables
3. User Created Variables
4. Creating And Running A Simple Script
5. Arguements And Postional Parameters
6. Passing Arguments To Script & Checking Return values
7. Testing The File Status
8. Numeric Comparisons
9. String Comparisons
10. If Statement
11. If-Then-Else
12. Read
13. Using Return Value
14. Using Exit Statement
15. Simple For-Loops
16. Advanced For-Loops
    • Using Runtime Arguments To Feed The For-Loop
    • Feeding Command Output Into For-Loop
    • Feeding User Input Into For-Loop
    • Feeding Data from a File Into For-Loop
    • Validating Data In For-Loop
    • Adding Numbers In For-Loop
17. While Loops
    • Feeding Data From Keyboard Into While Loop
    • Feeding Data From A File Into While Loop
18. Shift Command
19. Compound If-Then-Elif Statements
